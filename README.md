# inf-jstest-calc
Test for the JQuery Level 2 assessment for Infinity Dev Program

## Instructions

1. You've been provided HTML and CSS for a basic calculator.
2. You only need to implement the JS to make it work. You should aim to use jQuery as much as possible for this assessement. JQuery 3.4.1 has already been provided and included in the main index file and is available as `$`
3. You shouldn't need to but feel free to modify the HTML and CSS.
4. The calculator should allow you to click number buttons (1 or many) and then an operation button (plus, minus, divide or multiply) then some more number buttons (1 or many) and then finally, the equal button to output the result. To clear, press the C button and start again.
5. It is not necessary to allow users to add multiple numbers with just pressing the operation buttons, if you do implement that feature then it's will get bonus points.
6. The calculator does not need to support fractions as inputs. Fractions as output of a division operation must still be supported.
